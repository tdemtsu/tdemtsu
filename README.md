**`Comp Sci @ Cornell University (Google CSSI & TEC)`**

Hi there! I'm Thomas Demtsu, a computer science student at Cornell University. I've participated in Google's CSSI and TEC programs, where I gained hands-on experience in software development and web technologies. My passion for programming drives me to constantly learn and explore new technologies.
My web expertise lies in TypeScript, Python, Next.js, and React. I'm also comfortable working with Python and Java.

I have experience working with teams to develop and deploy applications, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems and delivering high-quality solutions.
In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and contributing to open-source software. 

Check out my GitHub repositories to see some of my work! Don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or just say hi.
